<h4>1. description</h4>
<p>landing page project is a project that relies on many sections like HTML, CSS, and specially javaScript. <br>This project is an application for most of the things we knew in the JavaScript & The DOM" section, <br>it is responsible to convert boring and non-responsive website into more responsive and alive ones, <br>by playing with each section color when we are reading it, to concentrate on the content of the section, <br>or by adding responsive navigation bar that can make scrolling to sections much easier and smoother <br>to reach, also if we needed to add another section it will be added to the navigation bar immediately <br>because it is responsive.</p>



<h4>2. procedure</h4>
<p>after finishing the "JavaScript & The DOM" section, I went to the project section and tried to know <br>the needs of the project, I didn't succeed in that, so I watched my project webinar recording, also the <br>PowerPoint file that was sent was so helpful to me, the tips were so clear and handy even if I didn't use <br>most of them but they explained to me the project.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>After downloading the needed files, I started first with creating the navigation bar using javaScript, <br>I used the fragment method for the performance, also innerHtml for adding the exact line of code <br>in Html, I modified the links in the bar by adding to each href the section id representing each <br>button "link" in the bar.</p>

<li><p>I searched in google for a method that can help me in making scroll behavior smooth, I found <br>the answer in w3schools, it was CSS code, I just edited Html default scrolling behavior to smooth.</p>

<li><p>The tough part, active class thing, I tried many things and searched for many things in google, <br>MDN, and W3Schools. I got many answers but both onScroll Event and Intersection Observer API <br>were the best solutions. onscroll technique had some issues especially in section 1, so I  studied <br>the Intersection Observer API technique and as you see it was perfect.</p>
</ul>
